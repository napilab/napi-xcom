# Napi-X WhitePaper

## Market

The primary market consists of organizations leveraging ARM single-board computers. Due to the niche's narrow focus, major distribution developers tend to overlook embedded system distributions, opting instead for solutions aimed at the mass market. Hardware manufacturers typically customize standard Linux by tweaking the bootloader or, at best, leaving users to compile the operating system from sourceâ€”a task that can be daunting for untrained individuals.

For instance, manufacturers of RockChip devices commonly offer Ubuntu, Debian, or Armbian (a derivative of Ubuntu). Some models even feature a Chinese OpenWRT clone (iStoreOS).

## Competitors

The market landscape is populated with a mix of classic distributions and proprietary solutions:

- **Classic Linux for ARM:** Debian, Ubuntu, and DietPi are bulky and lack firmware-like features (rollback, live updates, live backups, reset to default).
- **Router Firmware OpenWRT:** Limited software suite designed for Wi-Fi routers, outdated web engine, and restricted hardware compatibility.
- **iStoreOS:** A Chinese OpenWRT clone.
- **Robustel OS:** A Debian-based system with a web interface tailored for Robustel devices.

## Clients

- **DIY Enthusiasts:** Value stable, long-term operation.
- **Automation-Focused Organizations:** Rely on embedded Linux solutions for their projects.
- **Large Enterprises:** Require centralized management of "device swarms."

## Openness and Community

Focusing on open-source core features helps build a big community of enthusiasts who can work on adapting hardware and developing software. Open-source not only brings in more people but also creates an active and supportive community around the project.

## Goals

- Achieve a leading position among distributions.
- Build a strong reputation within the community.
- Create a loyal user community.
- Foster and develop the Napi-X community.
